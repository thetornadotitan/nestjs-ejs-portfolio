    <p class="mt-2 text-[var(--text)] leading-relaxed">
      I am a systems-oriented engineer driven by curiosity, iteration, and
      autonomy. From an early age I was drawn to understanding how rule-based
      systems work and how they can be improved from within. Today I design
      backend architectures and technical systems with the same philosophy:
      clarity over noise, performance over excess, and steady refinement over
      spectacle.

    >
      <h2 class="font-medium">Early Curiosity</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed">
        Around ten years old I discovered you could decompile Flash games.
      </p>

      <div
        class="mt-4 rounded-2xl border border-[var(--border)] bg-[var(--surface-2)] p-4"
      >
        <p class="text-sm text-[var(--text)] leading-relaxed">
          I was experimenting with Visual Basic and WinForms and realized you
          could load a decompiled SWF into a player, hook into button events,
          scan memory values, and modify internal logic. What began as simple
          edits gradually evolved into deeper experimentation.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-[var(--text)] leading-relaxed">
          I used CheatEngine to locate values in memory, create code caves, and
          reroute execution paths. Sometimes it was to make a game easier. Other
          times it was to remove mechanics that felt artificial or unnecessarily
          restrictive. Occasionally it was to add functionality that I thought
          should have been there from the start.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed">
        Looking back, it was not really about cheating. It was about learning
        that systems are structured sets of rules, and that those rules are
        knowable. If you understand them deeply enough, you gain meaningful
        freedom inside them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Rules & Perspective -->
    <div
      class="rounded-2xl border border-[var(--border)] bg-[var(--surface)] p-6 shadow-sm"
    >
      <h2 class="font-medium">Rules and Perspective</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed">
        A principle that stuck with me early came from my father, an Army
        veteran.
      </p>

      <div
        class="mt-4 rounded-2xl border border-[var(--border)] bg-[var(--surface-2)] p-4"
      >
        <p class="text-sm text-[var(--text)] leading-relaxed">
          He said you can only win by knowing the rules better than your
          opposition and using them creatively to your advantage.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-[var(--text)] leading-relaxed">
        I did not take that in a combative way. I generally get along with most
        everyone, and I prefer cooperation to conflict. For me the point was
        structural literacy. If you understand the framework, you are not
        constrained by it in the same way as someone who does not.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed">
        I have also learned to trust my intuition about people and situations.
        Experience has shown me that when something feels misaligned, it usually
        is. That signal is quiet, but it has been reliable enough that I respect
        it now.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Autonomy & Power -->
    <div
      class="rounded-2xl border border-[var(--border)] bg-[var(--surface)] p-6 shadow-sm"
    >
      <h2 class="font-medium">Autonomy and Power</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed">
        When I was younger, I was drawn to power in games. Over time I realized
        what I valued was autonomy.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-[var(--text)] leading-relaxed">
        The power I care about is not power over others. It is the ability to
        move freely, remove unnecessary friction, and shape the experience
        rather than passively accept it.
      </p>

      <div
        class="mt-4 rounded-2xl border border-[var(--border)] bg-[var(--surface-2)] p-4"
      >
        <p class="text-sm text-[var(--text)] leading-relaxed">
          That instinct extends into life. I want the power to live
          intentionally, to support myself and my family, to navigate complex
          systems without being overwhelmed by them, and to help when I can.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed">
        A lot of what looks like “breaking systems” from the outside is, for me,
        a desire to understand them well enough to improve them.
      </p>

    >
      <h2 class="font-medium">Modding and Tinkering</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed">
        I have always enjoyed modifying and extending systems, especially when
        there is a clear set of mechanics underneath.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-[var(--text)] leading-relaxed">
        I have created mods for games like Oblivion, Skyrim, and Bannerlord,
        adding functionality through supported APIs, community tooling, and user
        created libraries.
      </p>

      <div
        class="mt-4 rounded-2xl border border-[var(--border)] bg-[var(--surface-2)] p-4"
      >
        <p class="text-sm text-[var(--text)] leading-relaxed">
          I like finding the seams in architecture. The boundary between what is
          allowed and what is possible. When something feels arbitrary, I want
          to inspect it. When something feels restrictive for no good reason, I
          want to understand why.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed">
        I do not approach systems with the intent to break them for its own
        sake. I approach them with the intent to understand them deeply, then
        adjust them responsibly so they better match their purpose.

        <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed">
          Iteration is central to my process. I like tight feedback loops. Make
          a small change, re-run tests, measure, then improve it again. Over
          time those small improvements compound into something substantial.
        </p>

          What I optimize for
        </h3>
        <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed">
          I design backend architectures, APIs, and data pipelines that
          prioritize clarity, maintainability, and performance. Sloppiness and
          unnecessary complexity obscure intent and introduce fragility.
          Complexity should reflect real constraints, not accidental design.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-[var(--text)] leading-relaxed">
      I prefer designing new systems because it allows clarity to be built in
      from the beginning. However, refining and optimizing existing systems can
      be equally meaningful when approached thoughtfully. What matters is
      understanding the mechanics beneath the surface. When you understand the
      structure, you can improve it deliberately rather than reactively.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed">
      Control, to me, does not mean rigidity. It means visibility and
      understanding. Knowing what is happening and why, and being able to adjust
      with intention.

        <p class="text-sm text-[var(--text)] leading-relaxed">
          I enjoy incremental systems, but only when there are active elements
          and real choices to make. If progression is purely passive with a few
          button clicks, it is not quite enough. I like trade-offs, planning,
          and optimization that changes outcomes.
        </p>

      <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed">

      <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-[var(--text)] leading-relaxed">
        I enjoy seeing complex systems explained clearly and thoughtfully.
        Sometimes I imagine presenting similar ideas myself, not because I am

        articulating structure well.

          I am pragmatic, private, and exploratory. I build to solve and to
